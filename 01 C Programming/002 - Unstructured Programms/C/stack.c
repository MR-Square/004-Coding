/* Hi my name is MOHD.RAZA I am a learner of computer.I want to share my knowledge about stack with you.
 In this programme we will see the stack.Lets start.
  I am doing it with neso acadmy.

// What is stack?
// A stack is a liner data structure in which insertion and deletion are allowed only at the end,called the top of the stack.


	//1. push(data): It is used to inserts data onto stack.
	//2. pop()     : It is used to deletes the last inserted element from the stack.
	//3. top()     : It is used to returns the last inserted element without removing it.
	//4. size ()   : It is used to returns the size(number of elements in stack) of stack.
	//5. isEmpty() : It is used to check whether the stack is empty or not(it returns TRUE if the stack is empty,else returns FALSE).
	//6. isFull()  : It is used to check whether the stack is full or not(it returns TRUE if the stack is full,else returns FALSE).

	//  		ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION OF STACK
/*
	To indicate that the stack is empty,we will put -1 in the variable top.
	(Note: top=0 indicates that the topmost element is at index 0 and this means there is only one element in the stack.)
    * For the push opration 
	1. top is incremented by 1.
	2. New element is pushed at the position top.
	(Note: stack full ho jane k baad hum us me or values push nahi kar sakte, is situation ko overflow kahte hai. )
	* For pop opration
	1. The element at the position of top is deleted.
	2.top is decremented by 1.
